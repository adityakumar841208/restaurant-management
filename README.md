# Restaurant Management System

This is a simple restaurant management system built to help restaurants efficiently manage customer orders, payments, and inventory. It enables users to place orders and make payments through a seamless web interface, while restaurant owners can manage these orders through an easy-to-use backend.

## Features

### For Customers:
- **Place Orders**: Browse the menu, select items, and place orders.
- **Make Payment**: Use UPI (like PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm) to make payments for orders.
- **Order Tracking**: After payment, users can track their orders and receive confirmation.

### For Restaurant Owners:
- **Order Management**: View incoming orders and their details.
- **Payment Confirmation**: Receive payment transaction details from customers.
- **SMS Notifications**: Get notified when an order is placed, including payment confirmation and customer details.
  
## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **HTML**: Structure of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive elements and dynamic content on the page.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime environment.
- **Express**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud-based NoSQL database for storing customer orders and payment information.

### Payment Integration:
- **UPI (PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm)**: Integrated payment system where users enter their transaction ID to confirm orders.

### SMS Integration:
- **MSG91 API**: Used for sending order and payment confirmation SMS notifications to the restaurant owner.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB Atlas Account**: Sign up at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create a cluster.
- **MSG91 API Key**: Sign up at [MSG91](https://www.msg91.com/) and get your API key to send SMS notifications.

### Clone the Repository

### Setup MongoDB Atlas
1. Create a cluster in MongoDB Atlas.
2. Get your MongoDB connection string from the Atlas dashboard.
3. Replace the connection string in the `config.js` file under the `dbURI` field.

### Configure MSG91
1. Register on [MSG91](https://www.msg91.com/) to get your **API key**.
2. Replace the `authkey` field in the API request inside your backend service.
